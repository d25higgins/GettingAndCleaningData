Study Design

This study is a summerization of parts of the data set developed in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. Information about the origianl study and the authors is given below. In this study, Mean and Standard Deviation variables from the original study are isolated and the mean is taken.  The results are in a file called the tidyDataSet.txt.

The study was conducted using R with a purpos build script called run_analysis.R.

Code Book

All variables except activities and subjects have had their original datapoints normallized by the study authors and therefore the units are no longer significant.

All variables except activities and subjects now represent the MEAN of the variable data grouped by the activities and subjects variables. That is to say the values are the Mean of the mean, or the mean of the standard deviaition.
