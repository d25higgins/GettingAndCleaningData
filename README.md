## Tidy Data from a previous study

The script file run_analysis.R is used to produce a tidy data set from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

The script is self-contained and requires no inputs.  It is assumed that the script will run from a current working directory and will build its own data directory underneath it.  The link to the original data is embedded in the script and it should run and produce the tidyDataSet.txt in the same ./data/ directory.

If the machine where the script is to be run doesn't have some of the necessary scripts, then the install.packages lines at the top of the script file should be uncommented before running.

Included with this file and the R script should be a codebook file with information on the variables and data produced.  

The run_analysis.R file is fairly well documented if there are any questions about the methodology.  There is no additional INSTRUCTION LIST file since there are no manual operations.
